Here's the innovative part: We bridge Web2 credentials into this system using **Reclaim Protocol's zkTLS**. Any user's identity or activity proof from platforms like Login cred in web2 applications suck as your trade stocks web2 or fetch users travels history for payment of travel tickets and more, or exchanges becomes a verified credential—all while maintaining privacy.
